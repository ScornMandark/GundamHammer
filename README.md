Welcome aboard, pilots!  It was the year 0079, and also CE 71, and also PD 323.  All across time, space, and realities, a sudden and unexplained flash of light and energy was seemingly seen everywhere.  Brilliant enough to blink at, it was gone almost as soon as it registered.  People quickly forgot about it, having no impact on their lives.  They continued to live, work, fight, and die.  Even as war raged throughout the different timelines, some commanders began reporting strange encounters - squads from the past, squads of mobile suits from completely unknown places, and some quiet whispers of monsters from nightmares.  Some of these encounters ended peacefully; most ended in bloodshed.  This is the world of GundamHammer 40k - where giant war machines fight battles against the enemies that they know, and against enemies that they could never have imagined.  While some scientists work to understand this strange and chaotic dimensional rifting, most soldiers are just content to survive another battle.

GundamHammer 40k is a set of rules and units to bring the warfare of Gundam, Macross, and other series featuring giant mecha onto the tabletop for battle!  Based on the rules of Warhammer 40,000 9th edition, the rules and units presented here do not alter the basic rules of 40k.  Treat this codex and the various supplements as just another set of faction codexes.  

Gundark Future is a different set of rules for battling with your giant mecha units.  Based on the easy to learn and play Grimdark Future from OnePageRules, these new army lists don't change the basic rules of Grimdark Future, and are costed and calculated using the Custom Unit tool available.

Mecha: HEX is similar to Battletech, in that it's designed around smaller scale mecha duking it out over hex-grid or free-form maps.  Based on Warfleets: FTL from OnePageRules, it's a total conversion of that system, with similar but a few different mechanics.
