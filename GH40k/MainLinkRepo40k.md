# GundamHammer40k Main Link Repository

Welcome to the Link Repository for GundamHammer 40k, 9th edition!  With the basic rules for 40k 9th edition officially released for free online (https://warhammer40000.com/rules/), it’s time to upgrade from 8th to 9th!  Fortunately, most of our existing Codex Supplements are still in good shape, and they just need some minor edits to bring them up to date.

GundamHammer 40k is designed with HG, RG, MSIA, 1/144 kits and N-scale scenery in mind, but as long as the scale is mostly consistent it shouldn't really matter.  It's been played with models and miniatures anywhere from 1:400 and 1:285 up through 1:100 and 1:60! We’ll keep this post updated with Codex Supplements and other files as we get them finished.

Games Workshop has released a whole playlist of videos of how to play 9th edition, aimed at newer players!  Each part of the turn sequence is broken down, and basic concepts are explained pretty well.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoG9tQNvbd8&list=PLEaPE4sLDA7sDlGq4VZg9Tp325fFPusiN
