# Gundark Future Main Link Repository

One of the best tabletop miniature wargames out there, in my opinion at least, is Grimdark Future by OnePageRules.  It takes the somewhat traditional format of squads of miniatures, moving/shooting/hitting, hit-save-wound, buckets of d6's, etc and changes it up to be more fun and dynamic.  It's very much geared towards having a fun time with friends and enjoying the game, with a de-emphasis on 14 required sub-sub-sub manuals.
