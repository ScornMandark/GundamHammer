Let's blow up some giant robots!  I love gaming with my Gundam models, and now you can too! 

All the Army Lists and 2D standee Mobile Suits can be found here! Gundark Future: https://git.io/Jil2A


I've been developing GundamHammer40k for several years now, but I discovered One Page Rules through one of Wyloch's vids. I was really impressed by the streamlined gameplay, while still offering a lot of tactical depth. Plus, my 6 year old has started asking when we can play "that robot game", and I feel like OPR would be a perfect entry for him.  So, what's a body to do but subscribe to the Patreon, access the point calculator, and go to town!

As with GundamHammer 40k, these play a lot like the Titan Legions, albeit faster and leaner.  Note - basically every EFSF grunt unit is captured under the RGM-79 General Model or General Model Team with a wide variety of upgrades.  This allows players to also create a variety of custom units. Shown below are several example miniatures with associated upgrades.

Total: 5745 points

This was a 2000 point list in GundamHammer 40k 8th edition, but given the GF ~2x point increase over 40k it's probably not too far off. It took a really long time to play, though, although some of that was user input I'm sure. I think the Grimdark Future rules will help speed these games right along, though.
EDIT - following points updates and rebalancing, it would definitely be a different game!


 
Hopefully a preview of things to come! Thanks for reading this far.

OK, next up, the rebellious Mobile Suits of Z! 
These rebellious Mobile Suits are fighting for their freedom under the repressive yoke of EFSF repression!  Or so they claim...




With 3 MS-06 Zaps model teams (840 each), 2 MS-06 Zaps Models (420 each), and a single MS-06S Red Comet model (885), assuming no other upgrades, this is a cool 4,245 points.  Good, stompy fun!  :D 

(There are a variety of upgrade options available, but if you need a lot of stompy robots, then you need a lot of stompy robots!)



Nothing like the devastating surprise attack from a high speed robot.  The MS-18E Fighter, fully loaded, comes in at 1,120 high speed points, with multiple weapon systems at it's disposal.

A few people on the Discord channel mentioned that they wanted to give the game a try but were short on Gundam models. Not to worry! I've put together standee 2D Mobile Suits that you can print out and blow up! They print at about 5" tall, which is more or less the height of a 1/144 Gundam kit. I don't have all the variants or suits yet, but it's a start. (I also put together a list of links to keep the main page edits simpler.)

New army list! The mobile suits of the Zodiac Freedom Fighters (ZAFT) in CE71 are ready to uphold the longstanding Gundam tradition of Grand Theft Robot and fight for the colonies. (Updates to the other lists are coming presently, a combination of point and performance tweaks.)


The ZGMF-1017 Genie is the back bone of the ZFF army.  Stock loadout includes a Heavy Sword and Heavy Machine gun (410 points).  Standard weapon upgrades include swapping the machine gun for a bazooka and adding extra missile pods (+120 points).  Custom tuned machines may include high mobility boosters and veteran pilots (+140 points).

 
Difficult terrain challenges drive creative solutions.  The TMF/A-802 Barkue forms the core of the desert teams.  Low to the ground with the ability to shift into a high speed mode, this agile mobile suit packs a twin railcannon stock (535).  It can swap the main guns for a missile pod, and some of the finest ZFF pilots earned their veteran badges in them.  The TMF/A-803 YaGO is a custom prototype with an overcharged power plant and twin Beam Cannons (1040 points).  Its orange hull and almost animal savagery in combat has led Omnipresent Federation pilots to whisper fearfully about the Desert Tiger.




Left to Right: Aegis (1685 points), Duel + Assault Shroud (1260+285 points), Strike (TBD in the next list), Buster (1335), and Blitz (1205). The ZFF stole almost all of the prototype mobile suits the Omnipresent Federation created in CE71, but the Strike proved to be a major thorn in their side the entire war.  All of the G Series suits had different strengths, from raw power to speed and stealth.  One thing they all shared was the Phase Shift system, which effectively deflected the impact of physical weaponry.  Unfortunately this system consumed a tremendous amount of power, leaving the mobile suits drained a little more after every hit.


Finally the ZGMF-x13A Providence, the pinnacle of ZFF Mobile Suit design during CE71.  One of three units designed after the stolen G Series, it featured not only remote operated beam weaponry, but also the awful power of the Neutron Jammer Canceller, which allows it to operate nearly indefinitely, even with it's Phase Shift activated.

New Army List for the Omnipresent Federation in CE 71!  The Omnipresent Federation reacts poorly to the rebellious colonies, cracking down with extreme prejudice and alienating even their own soldiers.


The GAT-x105 Strike Devil, shows with 3 different Striker Weapon System Upgrades.  (Sword Pack (1250), Aile Pack+Beam Rifle+Shield (1300), Launcher Pack (1715)).  Some innovations that caught the Zodiac Freedom Fighters off guard were both the modular mission packs as well as the invention of Phase Shift, which rendered most physical weaponry useless against it.



After the ZFF stole several prototype Devil Units, the OF created several new ones, including the GAT-x133 Calamity Devil.  Loaded to bear with a bevy of beam weaponry, it's drug enhanced Biological CPU pilot was perhaps the most dangerous part of it's arsenal (With Hyper Bazooka upgrade, 2250).



Joining the mass production game later than the ZFF, the OF leveraged their industrial capabilities to catch up.  The GAT-01 Mass Produced Strike only came in one loadout to reduce cost and logistical complexity (665), while the GAT-01A1 Strike Dagger allowed for more flexible loadouts and even simplified Striker Weapon System packs (including beam rifle and shield, 745).

Orbital Neutral is a small island nation with advanced Mobile Suit research and production technology. Avowedly neutral in all political conflicts, they attempt to protect their own interests with their self defense force.


Shown here is a MBF-M1 Astray Model Team.  Their agile Mobile Suits, thruster packs, and beam weaponry provide them with a strong unit for limited mass production (1330 for the team).




Some of the most powerful prototype units of the first war defended Orbital Neutral.  The GAT-x105 Strike Devil Mu, shown here with the Perfect Pack upgrade, is a powerful all-rounder unit with deadly beam swords and a mega beam launcher (2085).  The MBF-02 Strike Devil Rouge, shown here with the Integrated Strike Weapon System Pack upgrade, is more focused on physical weaponry and assault (1430).  The ZGMF-x10A Freed Devil was originally a Zodiac Freedom Fighters unit, but was stolen and repurposed for defense of Orbital Neutral.  Piloted by one of the strongest coordinators of the war in CE71, it is a terror to face in combat (2380).

That wraps up the SEED units, I think it's time for some Macross  :D

Two new army lists!

The United Network of Spacers is a group of interstellar travelers lost far from home. Fleeing from the monstrously large Zentradus Armada, they leverage the power of their Battroid machines and raw guts of their ace pilots just to survive. Valkyries and Destroids two types of Battroids that they employ.  The Zentradus Armada is an ancient space fleet of giant warriors. These uncultured giants swarm their enemies with overwhelming numbers, even though the means of repairing their war machines has been lost for aeons. Their main battle units are the Regulders, semi-humanoid metal monstrosities that crush most other enemy forces beneath their heavy steel treads, and terrorize enemy armies with their shocking speed.



Shown here are 2 combined units of VF-1A Valkyrie Teams with no upgrades (1800 points for all 8 models), a single ADR-04-MK X Defender Team (1080 points for the pair), and a single MBR-04-MK IV Tomahawk Team (1440 points for the pair).  Note that while the VF-1A model out in front is out of cohesion with it's team in the rear, it's whole team is transformed into the Gerwalk form, while the middle Team is transformed into the Fighter form.



Shown here are 3 standard Regulder teams (1920 points for the 12 models) and 1 Regulder Heavy Weapons Team (Both with the standard Light Missile Pod, 535 points for the pair).

Next on the list, the Organization of the Zodiac.  The Organization of the Zodiac is the military arm of a foundation of aristocrats that moved to seize power from their planetary defense alliance. Leaning into the trappings of a decadent nobility, OotZ ruled their planet and orbiting space colonies with harsh laws. Using the combined industrial might of the planet and colonies, they were able to mass produce Mobile Suits, massive humanoid military machines that crushed traditional armed forces under their hyper-steel treads.


Being the primary target of the retaliatory Operation Meteor, the Organization of the Zodiac were forced to rapidly prototype multiple new types of mobile suits, eventually leading to the ill-fated introduction of Mobile Dolls, AI controlled Mobile Suits with no conscience of their own...

The list has been added to the main list, here: git.io/Jil2A



The OZ-06MS Leo is the backbone of OotZ forces, with a supremely flexible loadout.  Shown here (L-R) are a standard Leo with the Bazooka Upgrade (350), one with the Shield, Beam Saber, and MP Dobergun upgrades (555), and one with the standard Machine Gun but upgraded with Twin Beam Cannons (470).



They can also prove to be a highly capable air force.  Shown here are three Leos, all with the flight pack upgrades, and (L-R) the Beam Gun upgrade (380), the Heavy Beam Cannon upgrade (545), and the Shield and the Beam Rifle upgrades (605).


While there are a variety of mass produced mobile suits available for the Organization of the Zodiac to use, their leader typically uses the OZ-00MS Tall Goose, a high performance Mobile Suit from many years ago, tuned to the point that only ace pilots can withstand the stress.

Next up, the Operation Meteor crew!

You can't just let that Organization of the Zodiac run amok.  Operation Meteor has landed!



These 5 moody teenagers together clock in at just under 7k points before mid season upgrades, so plan your mission deployments carefully!

OK, last one from Wing for a while, I promise :)  


White Fang is an extremist group hell-bent on destroying the Organization of the Zodiac and freeing the colonies from planetary rule forever. Lacking the manpower to pilot enough mobile suits to effectively threaten OotZ, White Fang leaned heavily into Mobile Doll technology instead. These soulless machines are emotionless killers, following orders blindly. Their devastating Mobile Suits were massive humanoid military machines that crushed traditional armed forces and even other Mobile Suits under their titanium-alloy treads.



The White Fangs needed a powerful figurehead, though, so they brought onboard their own Devil Mobile Suit to challenge the pilots from Operation Meteor. Featuring a variant of the Zero System, their leader's Mobile Suit increased the efficiency of the Mobile Dolls but also showed them the path to Perfect Victory.



Here you can see 7 WF-02MD Virgo II units, with their Planet Defenser Beam Shields deployed.  Most have the standard Beam Rifle, but two have been upgraded with the heavier duty Beam Bazooka (~4,500 points).  



The figurehead leader of the White Fang takes a very active role in the high speed, melee-centric Epione Devil.  With an array of devastating close range weapons, the potentially deadliest weapon is the port of the Zero System, showing the pilot the perfect path to victory... at any cost. (1320 points)

I really like your home brewed Gundam rules. Could they be adapted for Battletech?

[b]ScornMandark:[/b]
Hi! Sorry, I didn't notice your reply at the bottom of the quote 🤦

Definitely! These are Grimdark Future rules, though, and less BattleTech-like. No specific location damage tracking, heat, or any of that stuff. Doable, but a very different game. If you're interested in a more BattleTech-like game, might I interest you in my other conversion, Mecha: Hex? This one was designed to be much more BT-esque, but based on Warfleets to help things stay snappy.

In Gundark Future news, I'm using the latest beta version of the 2.50 point calculator to update all the armies! Some weapons and suits are getting a pretty big overhaul, so keep an eye out.

2.50 overhaul has begun! So far, the EFSF and Zeon lists are updated, and I'm grinding through the rest. Besides a points update, the lists got a bit of a streamlining overhaul. I've been working to make sure that they're compatible with Army Forge once it starts supporting community content, so we should be able to drop it in day 1! Find all your Gundark Future goodness here: git.io/Jil2A

I'll post an update soon with some cost and content comparisons.
