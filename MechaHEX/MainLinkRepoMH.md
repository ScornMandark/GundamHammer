# Mecha: HEX Main Link Repository
I love me some giant, stompy robots, both on big maps and on hex grids.  I wanted to create a mecha game in the vein of Warfleets FTL, and this is my first pass.  The idea is that the units are fully generic with lots of room for you to interpret your own units as you see fit.  I'll be rolling out some faction specific army options in the near future, but for now have fun!
